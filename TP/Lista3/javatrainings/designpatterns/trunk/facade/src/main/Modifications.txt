Created DefaultBookstoreFacade

Facade Design Pattern:
A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains
lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working
with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has
dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.
