MODIFICATIONS

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of
an object using the same construction code.

ReportBody Interface has become a builder.

1. ADDED
        void putContent(Object content);
        void addCustomerInfo(SaleEntry saleEntry);
        void addItems(SaleEntry saleEntry);
   to ReportBody Interface.
2. ADDED implementations of methods to HTML, XML and JSON Report Bodies.
3. ADDED ReportBodyFactory for creating different report bodies without changing ReportAssembler code.
4. REMOVED excess code from ReportAssembler.
5. Dependency Inversion principle
    ReportAssembler doesn't communicate directly with HTML, XML or JSON Report Bodies.
    Instead ReportBodyFactory creates specific implementations of Report Body interface.
